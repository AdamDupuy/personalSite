I have just finished my first iteration of this site! Below is some information on the development process.

Tech Stack:
- JIRA (documentation)
- Create React App (initial creation of page)
- MUI library (library used for page structure and content)
- CSS (styling)
- Github pages (deployment)
- This repository (version control)

I wanted a portfolio site to post my projects, display my resume, make me more accessible to contact, and show my capabilities in building a react page. My development process consisted of multiple sprints with many designs and changes. Both my theme and structure of the projects page were completed and then redone completely because user feedback indicated there were improvements to be made.
I wanted a conditionally rendered page that can be used for mulyiple pages. That was the Contact and About Me pages.
I intend to revisit and refactor this page 1-2 times a year as well as update it with any resume/project changes as they occur. 
Next release I would like to try my hand at a one page scroll structure with the header jumping to the aforementioned section. 

Thanks for reading :)
